Clearing is an operation to target and engage MCA to eliminate or neutralize it from a network or system. Cyber Warfare Publication (CWP) 3-33.4:

Clear is normally used relative to the removal of barriers or obstacles in mobility operations or the deconfliction of targets for engagement. In the context of CPT operations, clear is defined as an operation to target and engage MCA in order to eliminate or neutralize it from a network or system, and may include actions to interdict, contain, disrupt, or degrade MCA. The CPT clear function occurs when the supported or supporting commander directs the CPT to eliminate or neutralize the identified threat on the network or system. CPTs may also be directed to take other actions against identified threats rather than clearing them.
Supporting commander is ultimately responsible for the system/network

According to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800.61r2, the IR lifecycle consists of four phases.
	Preparation
	Detection and Analysis
	Containment, 
	Eradication, and Recovery
	Post-incident Activity

Contain affected systems and networks simultaneously to prevent adversary repositioning.
Neutralize and eradicate adversary activities in each network or system
Observe and characterize adversary behavior and Tactics, 
Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) to enable follow-on operations (i.e., enable hardening)
Enable recovery or restoration of affected systems and networks

A variety of tools and techniques are employed, such as monitoring software, log and error message aggregation, querying platforms, and security systems (e.g., Network Security Monitors [NSM], firewalls, and Intrusion Detection Systems [IDS]). 

	After detection has confirmed a likely incident, the system should be contained for further investigation and remediation. Containment limits the extent of any damage a breach may have already initiated, such as data exfiltration or damage to production systems. 
	Containment isolates a known compromise. If the adversarial actors have proceeded no further than the affected systems, the remainder of the network is protected. When this affects production servers, backup plans need to be initiated in parallel with network containment. 

A new PowerShell script was found. An innocuous profile script related to the default PowerShell configurations was also found. Opening this file in Notepad shows that it also contains a script to call back to the malicious IP address. It also has a creation time and date in close proximity to the other malicious script. It appears that the threat actors added innocuous padding to the file to prevent its signature from being identical to the first, but analysis of the code reveals that it accomplishes the same intent.

Mission Relevant Terrain in Cyberspace (MRT-C) and Key Terrain in Cyberspace (KT-C) are an especially important focus during the hardening phase. MRT-C and KT-C will be determined during mission planning.
"(FOUO) The end state of the hardening function is to mitigate risk of adversary exploitation, or reduce it to levels acceptable to network or system owners." CWP 3.33-4

Guidelines are recommendations on a course of action to best meet specified requirements. NIST has developed several guidelines in their Special Publications (SP), which lay out best practices for several processes. There are several SPs that a CDA may find useful while hardening within the SP 800 series including, but not limited to:
	SP 800-53: Catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems  
	SP 800-40: Relates to patch managementSP 
	800-41: Relates to firewall configurationSP 
	800-123: Relates to central server security

CPTs issue or provide input to the following reports after hardening a mission partner network (from CWP 3.33-4):
	Detailed Host Vulnerability Finding and Corrective Actions Report: Covers patch management and outdated software vulnerabilities, services, and detailed vulnerability scanner results (e.g., results from Assured Compliance Assessment Solution [ACAS] and misconfigurations).
	Detailed Network Vulnerability Findings and Corrective Actions Report: Covers at least the following elements, if applicable — proper sensor placement, signature management, firewall implementation, firmware vulnerabilities, ports/protocols, access control lists, or infrastructure configurations. 
	Detailed Non-Technical Vulnerability Findings and Corrective Actions Report: Covers policy assessment from NIST SP 800-53 and mission partners utilizing intelligence to inform DCO.
	Risk Mitigation Plan (RMP): Documents all vulnerabilities identified during threat mitigation. This document includes recommendations for internal and external mitigation actions to reduce the overall risk to the secured network. This is further discussed in upcoming lessons.

Consult the NIST SP 800 series for guidelines and best practices for these devices as well as STIGs to ensure that systems and network devices meet security baselines. Once you understand the mission partner's operational cyberspace, recommend changes. The goal is to:
	Propose network architecture changes to improve security and reduce riskEnsure unnecessary services are disabledEnsure latest patches are installedRemediate insecure configurationsAudit installed softwareEnforce an audit policyEnhance security systems and logging

Source and destination Network Address Translation (NAT) are implemented. While the NAT’s primary purpose is not meant to be security, it has the added benefit of preventing internet devices from initiating connections with internal hosts, which greatly reduces the attack surface. 

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and SSH are enabled. Remote administration is possible. The SNMP protocol should be disabled, if not in use, as it allows attackers to read configuration settings and gain various other information from the device. If not actively used, then extra services should be disabled. The mission partner mentioned administrators using SNMP to gather metrics on routing devices, and using SSH to remotely manage their devices.

The router is logging events, but only locally. If the mission partner wants to be able to easily detect scanning and mapping activities, then enable remote logging. As this is the only device with an interface and a public IP in the network, most scanning happens here.
